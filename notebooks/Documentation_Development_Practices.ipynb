    "This is a list of some of the development practices that went into developing *Stonktastic* as well as instructions on how to use some of the tools presented below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conda\n",
    "*Source* : https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "*Description* :\n",
    "Conda provides an enviroment to develop projects in without the worry of having to manage multiple versions of libraries and installs. For instance, at the time of this projects writing, *Tensorflow* could not handle python 3.8.1 (current version) and instead could only work with python 3.6. Managing a web of those dependencies between projects can be a huge hassle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda is thus used to keep each project and its dependencies isolated from one another and provide a large enviroment to develop in.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing Conda\n",
    "To install conda, an install program needs to be run on your computer. Use the link above to find the latest copy for each operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a Conda enviroment\n",
    "The following command creates a new conda enviroment. Change the name of [myenv] to whatever you want your installation to be called. We used *Stonk* for our conda install.\n",
    "- *conda create -n [myenv] python=3.6*\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activating and Deactivating a Conda Enviroment\n",
    "This will activate conda in your enviroment. Once active you will need to deactivate it if you want to turn it off.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Activating Conda**\n",
    "- *conda activate [myenv]*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deactivating Conda**\n",
    "- *conda deactivate [myenv]*\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local Editable Install\n",
    "In order to have greater accessability to the project from outside the direct folder, we will install the project as a *Local Editable Package*. This also helps with the later push to have the finished project downloadable and installable as a package. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebooks also have easier access with a local install as they only need to import the specific functions in the library from the enviroment rather than using path references. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can install a project as a local editable install with a *setup.py* file and a *setup.cfg* file. \n",
    "\n",
    "- *pip install -e .*\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### setup.py and Setup.cfg\n",
    "Two files will need to be added to your project in order to preform the local install: *setup.py* and *setup.cfg*. Setup.py requires only two lines of code (refer to projects setup.py for reference) and uses the setup.cfg for the configuration of the local install, namely where it is located and other metadata.\n",

    "## Pip8 Compliance\n",
    "*Source: https://pep8.org/*\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "*Description:*\n",
    "Pip8 is the style guide for pythons standard library and is considered the standard in terms of code stucture and stlye. There are other styles that are commonly used but as *Pep8* is the most commonly used and the official style guide the Stonktastic team went with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of using a style guide is to make code more understandable and readable so that other people editing or working with your code (or even a future version of you that has forgotten details) can quickly be able to read and understand what this specific piece of code is doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The specifics of the style guide can be found on the link above. We used three libraries to help style our project (that are mentioned more in the *Structure* documentation), *isort* for the imports, *black* for the layout and *pylint* for the structure and for variables.\n",

    "## Using Sphnix\n",
    "*Source: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/*\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "*Description:*\n",
    "Sphnix is a fantastic way to auto-document your code after following some simple steps in setting up an configuration page and changing the comments in your code to be compliant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis of Sphnix is that it will automatiacally scan through your code and look for block comments at the begining of each page, function or class. These will then be used with the configuration file and used to automatically generate documentation for your code in multiple formats. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its good practice to describe each function/class/page on what its intended purpose is, explain the inputs and what type of data can be used (is variable 'A' a string, int or list?) and the outputs of the function and what type variable they are. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting up Sphnix\n",
    "Go to the main page of your project and type\n",
    "- *sphinx-quickstart*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this window put in the details that you want for your code documentation before navigating to the newly created *docs* folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you will need to set up your configuration script (*docs/source/index.rst*) using the guide listed above in source. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, once the index is set up and the comments correctly placed in the code, navigate to the *docs* folder and type the following:\n",
