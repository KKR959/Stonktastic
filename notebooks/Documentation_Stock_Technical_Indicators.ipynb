    "You can calculate Bollinger Band's by calculating the simple moving average of a stock as well as the standard deviation of the stock over that same time period. You then add the standard deviation to the moving average to get the upper band and subtract the standard deviation from the moving average to get the lower band.\n",

    "\n",
    "This indicator relies on the concept that if there are more *buyers* of a stock, the price will go up. Also if there are more *sellers* of a stock the price will go down. While this is often true it often does not capture the entire picture and the estimates can fall short."

    "The general idea wiht Stochastics is that when a stock is trending upwards, then the closing price will be higher than the daily average. While this is a simple to calculate indicator it is still highly accurate and used widely among traders."

    "\n",
    "You can calculate Williams Percent Range by subtracting the highest high over a 14 day period with the day's close and dividing that value by the highest high over a 14 day period minus the lowest low over a 14 day period. \n",
    "\n",
    "This indicator is used to show how the current value is in relation to the last 14 days of values for the stock. When the value is between -20 and 0 the price is overbought. When the value is between -80 and -100 the stock is oversold. This indicator is often prone to providing false signals of trend changes that may or may not happen."
